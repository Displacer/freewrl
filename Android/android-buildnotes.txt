FreeWRL (FreeX3d) - Android build notes

Quick:

0) get tool sets, helper files, etc.

	- get the Android build tools and install. (both NDK and SDK toolsets)

	- get the libxml2.tar file from:

		http://freewrl.sourceforge.net/AndroidBuild/libxml2.tar.gz

	- get the jpeg.tar file from:

		http://freewrl.sourceforge.net/AndroidBuild/jpeg.tar.gz

	- get freetype from:

		http://freewrl.sourceforge.net/AndroidBuild/freewrl-cdave1-freetype2-android-006e528.tar.gz

		(this is a modified version of the freetype build from http://freetype.org, simplified at
		https://github.com/cdave1/freetype2-android, but include paths changed in the Android.mk file 
		in "our" version shown above)

	  uncompress, untar and put them in the "freewrl" directory (the parent of the "Android" directory)


	Your base FreeWRL directory will probably look something like this now:

	Johns-MacBook-Air:Android johns$ ls ..
	Android					cdave1-freetype2-android-006e528	jpeg
	CVS					freewrl					libxml2
	OSX_gui					freewrl2
	SoundEngine				freex3d


1) cd to Android

2) get the package set up with the android tools. Issue the command:

	android update project --target 1 --name FreeWRL --path ./

3) plug your testing device in. Edit the "make-install" script, and put the device id
in. eg:

	prompt> adb devices
	List of devices attached 
	388924841bf5497	device

You may have to enable "USB Debugging" on your Android device.

4) ndk-build appears to require the exact full path to it; EDIT the make-install to put
   the full path in. You'll see the path for my system, eg:

	/Users/johns/Desktop/Android-tests-current/android_tools/android-ndk-r7/ndk-build

5) sh make-install should build, and install onto your device.

6) "adb logcat" when your Android device is connected and in debug mode; 
   "adb logcat | grep FreeWRL" will show you only the FreeWRL messages.
