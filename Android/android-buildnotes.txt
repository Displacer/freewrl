FreeWRL (FreeX3d) - Android build notes


Pre-Requisites:

Android NDK and SDK development environment.


ICU included from Android GIT repository - this is to satisfy headers when 
compiling libxml2.

libxml2 - Some tweaks were made to the encoder (mbstowcs / wcstombs). This will
need re-visiting at some point in the future. If you experience failures to read
xml files, that are wide character based, this is a good place to start.


Compilation:

cd to freewrl/Android
issue the ndk-build command


Android Files (freewrl/Android) :


Under jni is the master make file (Android.mk). This will build libxml2 and the freex3d 
library. Paths to libxml2 and icu will need tweaking to suit your environment. I attempted to 
make these relative but could not get the 'C' includes to resolve correctly.

libxml2 and ICU are available from the Android GIT repository.


default.properties

This files sets the platform specific headers/libraries that the NDK will use, under
($NDK)/platforms. Currently targets android-5.


under FreeWRL-Android-static are 3 helper source file and the Android config.h
The source files contain unresolved gui functions, version info, and some helpers to start 
calling the library from an Android / Java front end.


All Android specific code changes should be wrapped in #if defined(_ANDROID). The Android
make files define this directive on the compilers command line.
