FreeWRL (FreeX3d) - Android build notes

1) get tool sets, helper files, etc.

	- get the Android build tools and install. (both NDK and SDK toolsets)

	- get the libxml2.tar file from:

		http://freewrl.sourceforge.net/AndroidBuild/libxml2.tar.gz

	- get freetype from:

		http://freewrl.sourceforge.net/AndroidBuild/freewrl-cdave1-freetype2-android-006e528.tar.gz

		(this is a modified version of the freetype build from http://freetype.org, simplified at
		https://github.com/cdave1/freetype2-android, but include paths changed in the Android.mk file 
		in "our" version shown above)

	- get the ActionBarSherlock from:

		http://freewrl.sourceforge.net/AndroidBuild/JakeWharton-ActionBarSherlock-4.1.0-0-g9598f2b.tar.gz

	  uncompress, untar and put them in the "freewrl" directory (the parent of the "Android" directory)


	Your base FreeWRL directory will probably look something like this now:

	Johns-MacBook-Air:freewrl johns$ ls
	Android					cdave1-freetype2-android-006e528
	CVS					freewrl
	JakeWharton-ActionBarSherlock-88fc341	freewrl2
	OSX_gui					freex3d
	SoundEngine				libxml2


2) ActionBarSherlock.
	cd into the library subdirectory of ActionBarSherlock; probably this will work:
		cd *1/library
	assuming you are in the freewrl "root" directory, and the listing is as shown above.

	Issue the command:
		android update lib-project --path . --target android-15


	in the library folder. NOTE the target parameter; this builds with a target of 4.0.3.


2) Android building. cd into the "Android" directory.

	android update project --target android-15  --name FreeWRL --path ./ --library ../JakeWharton-ActionBarSherlock-88fc341/library

Note1: 	The target number must be for OS version 4.0.3 or later. "android list targets" will show you the
	targets; make sure "android-15" is shown as one of the possible targets.
Note2:	The path to the ActionBarSherlock path should actually point to the directory where the AndroidManifest.xml
	for the ABS project resides.
Note3:  MAKE SURE that only one reference resides in the project.properties file; if more than one copy, you will
	get lots of compile errors, due to duplicate references.

3) plug your testing device in. Edit the "make-install" script, and put the device id
in. eg:

	prompt> adb devices
	List of devices attached 
	388924841bf5497	device

You may have to enable "USB Debugging" on your Android device.

4) ndk-build appears to require the exact full path to it; EDIT the make-install to put
   the full path in. You'll see the path for my system, eg:

	/Users/johns/Desktop/Android-tests-current/android_tools/android-ndk-r7/ndk-build

5) sh make-install should build, and install onto your device.

6) "adb logcat" when your Android device is connected and in debug mode; 
   "adb logcat | grep FreeWRL" will show you only the FreeWRL messages.
