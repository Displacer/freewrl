In the mathematica/ directory :
Some mathematica notebooks.
This will show where some of the equations I used came from.

In the src/ directory :
These are debugging programs I made to help me figure out everything.
Might be usefull to visualise the workings of the algorithms.
Check the source to see key bindings. Fool around.
VERY sloppy code. Modify at your own risk.

In the tex/ directory :
This is the latex source and images of the two pdf files.
Run make here to generate pdfs.

tex/crc_stage.pdf : 
My intern report. In french. Very draft form. 
(It wasn't due till the week after).

tex/algo.pdf : 
General view of the workings of the algorithm. 
Uses some of the same images as crc_stage.tex.
