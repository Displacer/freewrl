<P>We have started running FreeWRL through the NIST Conformance Test Suite.
The initial results can be found under tests/Doc.
Since it usually takes a couple of passes through latex to get all the table
measurements and cross-references right, issue the make command until all warnings
such as the ones below no longer appear:
<P>
<BR>Package longtable Warning: Table widths have changed. Rerun LaTeX.
<BR>LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references.
<BR>LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.
<BR><BR>
<P>Then use the Makefile to create the document in the format of your choice:
<BR>
<LIST>
<LI> make dvi for the DVI file
<LI> make ps for the PS file
<LI> make pdf for the PDF file
