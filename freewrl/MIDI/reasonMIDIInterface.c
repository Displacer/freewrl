 Note that these files are stripped of comments, and non-Linux code. The reason for
 this is that Propellerheads' ReWire IP is protected - the Linux code does not 
 contain any ReWire protocol code (despite file names). At the present time, I am
 unsure if the original source, with all comments and #ifdefs, and Propellerheads'
 system calls can be released as open source.
