For 1.18.12:
	- soundengine work for 64 bit compiles.

	- change GL_LIGHT_MODEL_AMBIENT to 0,0,0,1 - removes default "scene" ambient lighting.

For 1.18.11:
	- OSX Build work.

	- New X3D Parser - does not yet handle:
		Scripts
		PROTOS
		EXTERNPROTOS
		PixelTextures.

	- SFColorSetHSV and SFColorGetHSV

For 1.18.10:
	- reviewing Javascript interfacing. Most SF* nodes should now pass
	  correctly.

	- ambientIntensity - Shape material now uses the ambientIntensity value,
	  and lights set ambientIntensity as per their node values, now.

	- PointLight status now same as other lights - uses lightState.

	- memory corruption in "default MF*" values fixed in createNewX3DNode.

	- memory leak in OcclusionQueries fixed.

	- some minor parser problems fixed. (some more identified)

	- fixed problem in *Background nodes when sky and ground entries were empty

	- X3dToVrml97.xslt changed - it was adding EXTERNPROTOS for 
	  nodes supported in FreeWRL.

	- Textures had a threading issue - registration code rewritten.

	- MovieTexture did not work with the new parser; fixed.

	- Makefile.PL - javascript library not copied over - fixed.

For 1.18.9:
	- no perl parser at all.

	- perl runtime code removed.

	- XLib error handler.

	- New Makefile.PL and new build process.
		- build revamp in progress - 1.18.9 has better linking on linux as
		  compared to 1.18.8 and earlier.



For 1.18.5:
	- Sound and AudioClip nodes should work again - problem with add_first and
	  these nodes.

	- EAI/SAI should be close to working.

For 1.18.4:
	- javascript code that calls perl being rewritten.
		(tests/52 added - uses createVrmlFromURL)

	- bug in OpenGL window size fixed. (affected TouchSensors)

For 1.18.3: Firefox plugin code -at least now it brings FreeWRL up. Have big problem
	with reparenting FreeWRL window - fails at plugin XFlush call.

For 1.18.2:
	- Desktop integration on Linux platforms. (Sarah Dumoulin)

	- more automated build in Makefile.PL (John Stewart) to better handle
	  Motif library inclusion. (including code rewrites in CFrontEnd)

For 1.18.1:
	- more PROTO work for experimental parser (Daniek Kraft)

	- Linux browser plugin reverified; should now work quite well!

	- command line invocation of http:// files restored. (was broken in 1.17).

	- remove requirement for GLwDrawA.h.


For 1.17.7:
	- javascript problem creating some nodes that had FreeWRLPTR defined fields fixed.

For 1.17.6;
	- now scans scientific notation floats correctly.

For 1.17:
	- new menubar operation, can be compiled without it. 

	- shape compiler thread, if supported by OS.

	- strncmp #ifdef deleted from code; made our function the default

	- SAI code changes (modifies EAI and interfaces in Browser.pm)

	- added EAI/SAI *ColorRGBA types

	- much work in making the Perl parser output use the SAI/EAI creation code;
	  this allows for code reduction, and for verification of EAI/SAI process.

For 1.16:
	- VisibilitySensor

	- bug in DirectionalLight rend fixed.

	- bug in script invocation - scripts are now initiated when routing entries
	  are made, not when first invoked.

	- H-Anim nodes being worked on.

	- Geometry2D nodes complete.

	- streamlining build and rendering process by reducing amount of C code in
	  VRMLRend.pm and VRMLC.pm

	- bug in IndexedFaceSet rendering fixed - degenerate triangle finding changed
	  so that all triangles are looked at in a face, and the one with the longest
	  vector length is the one chosen to represent the normal of that face.

	- re-arranged the CFuncs directory to better follow X3D Spec.

	- added nodes to the "topNodes" field - some warnings were printed for correct
	  scenegraphs pertaining to what nodes were allowed as root nodes.

	- reworked texture coordinates for Extrusion and ElevationGrid to handle Multi
	  Texture nodes (MultiTextureTransform, TextureCoordinateGenerator, etc...)

	- New nodes: 
		- TextureCoordinateGenerator node.
		- StaticGroup node.
		- TextureBackground node.
		- LoadSensor node. (has problems with Scripts)

	- EAI complete.



For 1.15:
	- Fixed dynamic linker bug with OSX 10.4.3

	- removed get3 and get2 method calls, leading to better error messages when
	  unexpected children are found in VRML code.

	- tagged all nodes with a unique type identifier, leading to better error
	  messaging at runtime for code with generated nodes.
	
	- MultiTextureTransform node support.

	- Sphere solid flag now works.

	- "Endian" bug fixed in Binding stack code.

	- collision turned off by default as it affected conformance; some of the
	  Web3D Interchange profile conformance tests assumed that the viewpoint was
	  within a primitive shape.

	- IndexedLineSet, LineSet, and PointSet  nodes up to spec compliance.

	- MultiTexture node support.

	- Ambient intensity light bug fixed.

	- X3D - duplicate DEFs now flagged.

	- parse META, PROFILE, COMPONENT in VRML encoded X3D files.

	- support for building rpms in Makefile.PL.

	- status bar updated to reduce size and increase information.

	- Threading problem in ProdCon fixed - mainly seen in EAI code.
	
	- Added NavigationInfo speed field values to FLY mode rotations and
	  translations.

	- fixed bug in Javascript invocation dealing with multi float
	  (3F, 4F) values. 

For 1.13:
	- Now use freely distributable font files. See the README in the
	  fonts directory.

	- EXTERNPROTOS can now reference PROTOS in the Extern'd file.

	- freewrlSystem now keeps a list of children; on doQuit it attempts
	  to remove these children from the system with a kill (child,SIGINT).
	  This solves a problem where wget can hang and leave the freewrl 
	  display thread around.

	- fixed a problem that caused add/remove children from EAI and
	  scripts to fail (segfault)

	- revised error messages where some field values are incorrect;
	  eg, putting a TextureCoord as a coord field of an IndexedFaceSet
	  now displays a more informative message.

	- Builds on 64 bit processors. Some scripting/EAI/CLASS links not
	  yet correct.

	- ColorRGBA nodes supported for IndexedFaceSet, and equiv. NOT
	  supported in scripting/eai yet.

	- updated Javascript version - new Mozilla SpiderMonkey version
	  is 1.5.

	- Javascripting - MF nodes and script to script routing now is
	  much better (may still be bugs, but it works for my tests)

	- EAI code changed so that the current Browser timestamp is
	  delivered to the EAI side of things. Right now, the EAI
	  java code (EAIinThread.java) reads and parses this time 
	  value, but does not do anything with it.

	- added all Triangle nodes - code was written in less than a 
	  day, so bugs may exist - it does however run the X3D Triangle
	  conformance tests successfully.

	- EAI EventOutMFFloat, EventOutMFVec2f, EventOutMFVec3f,
	  EventOutMFColor, EventOutMFRotation EventOutMFInt32 all revisited.

	- X3D - initial support for containerField.
