<P>
See the file
<A HREF="INSTALL.html ">./INSTALL.html</A>
for how to compile and install this program.

<P>
If you want to run this program <B>without installing,</b> 
have a look at the <b>"runme-standalone"</b> file in the 
build directory. It should give you enough information to enable
you to run FreeWRL without installing.
<p>
Of course, if you want to run without installing,
you need only to "make",
not "make install".

<p>
<P>For updates, see the FreeWRL homepage, currently at

<BR>freewrl tests/1.wrl</P>

<P>This should open a new window with a view of the VRML world in question.</P>

<P>Use the first and third button of your mouse (while moving your mouse)
to move around.</P>

<P>To change viewers between walk and examine, press 'w' or 'e' or 'd' in
the browser window ('d' only works with the keyboard currently).</P>
