<P>
See the file 
<A HREF="INSTALL.html ">./install.html</A>
for how to compile this program.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> This version (0.29) has broken default texture
mapping on Extrusions, IndexedFaceSets, and Elevationgrids. This
release has been "rushed" out for the Web3D Summer 2001 SDK; it
is expected that the default mapping will be completed before
August 2001. Apologies for this; the latest is always on the
CVS tree, in the development area.

<P>This file tells general things about freewrl as well as changes
between versions.</P>
