<P>
See the file
<A HREF="INSTALL.html ">./INSTALL.html</A>
for how to compile and install this program.

<P>
If you want to run this program <B>without installing,</b> you HAVE to set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable so that freewrl can find the shared libs. Try:
<p>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/luigi/FreeWRL-1.08/JS/js/src/Linux_All_OPT.OBJ/:/home/luigi/FreeWRL-1.08/blib/arch/auto/VRML/VRMLFunc/
<p>
Of course, change the paths to suit your build directory. The syntax above
assumes using csh or equivalent for your shell.
<p>
It should be noted that the freewrl executable file is in the directory
"CFrontEnd". ie, the freewrl executable, using the paths above, is:
<p>
/home/luigi/FreeWRL-1.08/CFrontEnd/freewrl
<p>
and, of course, when building (see the INSTALL.html file), you should "make",
not "make install".

<p>
<P>For updates, see the FreeWRL homepage, currently at
<A HREF="http://www.crc.ca/FreeWRL/">http://www.crc.ca/FreeWRL/</A></P>

<P>After installation, try:
<P>
<BR>freewrl tests/1.wrl</P>

<P>This should open a new window with a view of the VRML world in question.</P>

<P>Use the first and third button of your mouse (while moving your mouse)
to move around.</P>

<P>To change viewers between walk and examine, press 'w' or 'e' or 'd' in
the browser window ('d' only works with the keyboard currently).</P>

<P> E-mail any comments, questions & patches to <A HREF="mailto:freewrl-04 (at) rogers.com">
John Stewart</A>
(change the (at) in the email address to the at sign - anti spam measures...)</P>

<P>Thanks;
