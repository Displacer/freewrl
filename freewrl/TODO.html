Additions/comments welcome.

<UL>
<LI><B>DONE:</B> Had to disable addChildren fields for SAI; interfered with add
Children when using EAI. Figure out how not to get the invalid
event with both addChildren methods enabled.
<P>
<LI><B>STARTED:</B> Netscape Plugin, to provide better functionality than XSwallow.
<B>(It works, but needs to use Netscape's cache, and should have better Java integration)</B>
<P>
<LI><B>STARTED:</B> Fran Taylor sent in some great tips for getting FreeWRL to work 
	better with Netscape. Implement and document these.
<B>(Tied in to the work with Netscape Plugin, above)</B>
<P>
<LI><B>DONE:</B>EAI CreateTest working (needs replaceworld EAI call)
<P>
<LI><B>DONE:</B>DEF and USE's for textures.
<P>
<LI><B>DONE:</B>Rectangular pictures are not mapped correctly.
<P>
<LI><B>DONE:</B>Extrusion endCaps are facing the wrong way! (begincaps are ok)
<P>
<LI><B>DONE:</B>Display list and Texture binding works. Was: Does render_polyrep'd nodes use display/texture lists?
<P>
<LI><B>DONE:</B>	do_textures smooths textures, but make it NOT smooth pixeltextures. (need another
parameter) - see t4*wrl in luigi's home directory
<P>
<LI><B>DONE: </B>Try GL_CULLing backgrounds and basic shapes. (COSMO on the SGI does this)
this should double rendering speed for them.
<P>
<LI><B>E</B>xtrusion Textures not working reliably.
<P>
<LI><B>I</B>ndexedFaceSets are not using all points correctly. (check out the lightning bolt
example) (Kiwano.wrl, and ast.wrl)
<P>
<LI><B>D</B>EF and USE in createVrmlFromString examples (eg, Etiennes perl tests)
<P>
<LI><B>M</B>ore SAI work.
	- automatic creation of pipes.
<P>
<LI><B>H-</B>ANIM working.
	- Nancy "works", but:	
		1) run mode, arms flail around.
		2) face is not good. (IFS problem, again)
		3) buttons don't float properly. (rotation problem,
		   as in the robotic finger test???)
		4) what happened to the "stand" button?
<P>
<LI><B>Javascript - </B> the "Warbird" code fails on MFInt32. Make sure that all of JS/test.pl
works with all datatypes.
<P>

<LI><B>S</B>ensor nodes - dragging when on a sensor also causes navigation changes.
<P>
<LI><N>C</B>ompile time options for non-Linux systems, and some code changes to help compile on
other systems. (eg, IRIX changes from Mufti)
<P>
<LI><B>Javascript</B>errors when trying to run 
http://www.lug-s.org/dokumentation/software/vrml/vrmldemo/compressed/warbird.wrz
<P>
<LI><B>G</B>eoVRML working.
