Create config/IRIX 646 something

Edit config/IRIX.mk


by EJB (12/23/98)

- Added Linux_alpha.mk to config.  A copy of Linux_All.mk where
  CPU_ARCH is alpha, and  -mieee is added to compile flags to take care of
  floating point problems. 

- Modified Makefile to use Linux_alpha.mk when OS_CPUARCH is alpha and
  OS_ARCH is linux. 

- Modified alpha condition in prcpucfg.c

- Added linux_alpha subsection to prcpucfg.h based on results from
  modified prcpucfg which make sense on the 64bit alpha linux.

- Modified os/linux.h so things are only undefed for the non alpha linuxes.
