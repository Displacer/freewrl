	<TITLE>FreeWRL - Install</TITLE>
<H2>
Introduction
</H2>
The complexity of the install depends on what packages you have installed
with your system, and what packages may have been installed later.
<P>
Most installs are very simple.
<H3>
Installs for the impatient
</H3>

Either grab a pre-packaged version of FreeWRL (in rpm format), or grab
the source for FreeWRL and try:
<P><LIST>
<LI>gunzip FreeWRL-version-tar.gz
<LI>untar FreeWRL-version.tar
<LI>cd FreeWRL-version
<LI>perl Makefile.PL
<LI>make install
</LIST>
<p>
<h3>
Installs for everybody else
</h3>
<P>
<B>Linux and MacOS-X</B> are the build platforms for FreeWRL 0.38 and beyond.
<P>
<B>Mac OS-X users:</B> Congradulations! You now can compile and run FreeWRL. We have
put specific install directions
<A HREF="INSTALL-OSX.html">here</A>.
<P>
<B> Solaris users:</B> Congradulations are in order for you, too! Alex Prengel
of MIT has
put specific install directions
<A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/freewrl_v0.35/README.config">here</A>,
and more recently, Alberto Dubuc at Siemens.com has made changes to
the source code, and has added two README's to the top level directory.
(files README.RTS_Sun and README.SunCompilation)

<P>
<P>This install is divided up into the following sections:<P>
<LIST>
<LI>Building FreeWRL to run &quot;standalone&quot;, without Netscape.
<LI>Installing Java support.
<LI>Getting it all to work with Netscape.
<LI>Adding X3D functionality.
<LI>Getting it to work with the Polhemus Fastrak 3d, or a Joystick.
</LIST>

<P>
<H3>
Building FreeWRL as a standalone executable
</H3>

<P>
This is the place to start. Once it runs, you can configure more options for FreeWRL to use, like Netscape Plugin functionality.
<P>
<P>
You can get FreeWRL from:
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freewrl/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/freewrl/</A>
<P>
You can also access the cvs repository. The way to do it is explained at:

<BR>- <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=9120">http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=9120</A>
<p>
<H4>
0.0 Required Environment (Linux)
</H4>
<P>
Your Linux system requires some "development" RPMS - look for the following list. (note:
<B>rpm -qa | grep freetype2</b> will list all freetype2 rpms installed)
<p>
Thanks to Leandro Dias da Silva, the following rpms were required for Connectiva Linux:
<p>
XFree86-GL,
XFree86-GL-devel,
XFree86-GLU,
XFree86-GLU-devel,
freetype,
freetype-devel,
freetype2,
freetype2-devel,
libpng,
libpng-devel,
libjpeg,
libjpeg-devel,
and perl-base.
<P>
<H4>
1.0  OpenGL
</H4>
<P>
OpenGL is a "standard" on all distributions.
<P>
<H4>
2.0 Java Install.
</H4>
<P>
The java compiler, javac must be in your path. the command "which javac" will tell you
if you have this installed.
<P>
<p>
Java must be version 1.4 or later; the command "java -version" should show which version
you have. If you have the wrong version, then compile errors will happen, as some features
of Java Version 1.4 and above are used.
<p>
If you do not have java on your system, or it is not on your Linux distribution CDs in RPM format,
Java can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.blackdown.org">http://www.blackdown.org</A>.

3.0 FreeWRL Build and Installation
</H4>
<OL>

<LI>Grab the latest FreeWRL tar file, and untar it.
<P>
<LI>Verify that the <B>vrml.conf</B>
file has good paths for the libraries and includes.
Note particularly the possible defines in this file.
<P>
FreeType version 2 has been in distributions for years; FreeWRL now uses
it. Check that you have the library installed; the command "ldconfig -p | grep freetype"
will print the path, if it is installed.
If you have an older distribution, you can get a new version of FreeType from
<A HREF="http://www.freetype.org">http://www.freetype.org</A>.
<P>
<B>Note:</b> you may have to modify the FREEWRL_INC line in vrml.conf to point to the
path for FreeType2 header files. eg, for Slackware 8.1, you may wish to add -I/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2
and -I/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2/freetype to this line.
<P>
<LI>You might need to Install Perl Modules; if you get errors when building
FreeWRL, make sure you have the modules requested. (FreeWRL is slowly becoming
module independent, but...)
<P>
<P>Installing these modules is a no-brainer; just untar
each module as root, then go into the directory, and
<BR>perl Makefile.PL
<BR>make
<BR>make install
</P>

<LI>ImageMagick is required for some conversions of graphics
files. The "convert" utility is used; this <B>should</B> now be
installed with any graphical Linux distribution. If you
can't find it, you can always download it from
<A HREF="http://www.imagemagick.org">http://www.imagemagick.org</A>

<P>
<LI>Make the Make file

<P>perl Makefile.PL</P>

<LI>Build/install FreeWRL
<P>make
<BR>make install (you have to be root of course)
<P>
If you <B>do not<\b> want to install freewrl, you will have to set up
the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" correctly, to show freewrl where the libraries are.
The file "runme-standalone" is one example of what to do.
</P>
<P>
<LI>Run the numbered tests.

<P>
There are quite a few tests in the "tests" directory.
<P>Run all of the numbered files (and any others that you want!) in the tests
directory. Note that some use javascript, so you will be testing javascript, too.</P>
</OL>
<h4>
<P>4.0 Getting it all to work with Netscape/Mozilla/Konqueror, etc.
</h4>

<B>Mozilla/Netscape:</b>
If FreeWRL was built correctly, then the Netscape/Mozilla Plugin was
installed in the browser plugins directory. Stop and start your
browser, and enter "about:plugins" in the url entry box. You should
see the FreeWRL plugin listed.</P>
<P>
<B>Konqueror:</b> invoke the "settings" dropdown menu, then go and click on
"netscape plugins", and import the plugins. (check the build directory in
vrml.conf to determine exactly where the npfreewrl.so file is)
<p>
<P><B>5.0 X3D compatibility.</B></P>

<P><B>5.1)</B> Go to the x3d directory, and follow the

<A HREF="x3d/readme.html">instructions</A>.</P>
<P>
