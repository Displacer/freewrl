Install Introduction
</H2>
The complexity of the install depends on what packages you have installed
with your system, and what packages may have been installed later.
Most installs are very simple.
<P>
<B>Red Hat 7.2, Irix 6.5, and  MacOS-X</B> will be the build platforms
for FreeWRL 0.32 and beyond.
<P>
<B> Mac OS-X users:</B> Congradulations! You now can compile and run FreeWRL. We have 
put specific install directions
<A HREF="INSTALL-OSX.html">here</A>
.
<P>
For people with older versions of Linux, we have also tested the FreeWRL 0.29 build on brand new installs of:
<P>
<LIST>
<LI><B>SuSe 7.1</B> FTP'd on March 30-31 2001
<LI><B>TurboLinux</B> Workstation 4.0.5.SMC Tues Oct 19, 1999
<LI><B>Mandrake 7.2</B> from ISO CD images
<LI><B>Redhat 7.1</B> "SeaWolf" final release
</LIST>
<P>Others have tested FreeWRL on:
<LIST>
<LI><B>SGI Onyx II</B>
<LI><B>FreeBSD</B>
</LIST>
<P>
Detailed install notes can be found in this file (INSTALL.html) in the FreeWRL 0.29
release; most of what is in there should help with installing FreeWRL 0.32 and beyond
on these platforms.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>This install is divided up into the following sections:<P> 
<LIST>
<LI>Building FreeWRL to run &quot;standalone&quot;, without Netscape.
<LI>Installing Java support.
<LI>Getting it all to work with Netscape.
<LI>Adding X3D functionality.
<LI>Getting it to work with the Polhemus Fastrak 3d, or a Joystick.
</LIST>

<P>
<H3>
Building FreeWRL as a standalone executable
</H3>

<P>
This is the place to start. Once it runs, you can configure more options for FreeWRL to use, like Netscape Plugin functionality.
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Notes:</B> All files are available here:</P>

1.0  OpenGL
</H4>
<P>
OpenGL is a "standard" on all distributions.
<P>
Some OpenGL implementations are better than others, though. The two references used are the SGI OpenGL
implementation, and Mesa from
<A HREF="http://www.mesa3d.org">http://www.mesa3d.org</A>.
<P>
Text nodes now <B>really</B> use the OpenGL tesselator; you may experience character dropouts (VooDoo3 cards),
or even core dumps (older GeForce drivers), if your OpenGL drivers do not use the latest OpenGL.
<P>
If you fall into this category, there are various options available to you, the simplest is
to either ignore the errors, or install Mesa as indicated above.
<P>
<P>
<H4>
2.0 Java Install.
</H4>
<P>
The java compiler, javac must be in your path. the command "which javac" will tell you
if you have this installed.
<P>
<B>RedHat 7.2</B> needed Suns Java 1.2 or above installed. The open-source Java equivalent, Kaffe, is not
quite up to the job yet. With Kaffe, you will get Java compile errors, so for now, please use
Suns Java 1.2 or above.
<P>
Java can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.blackdown.org">http://www.blackdown.org</A>.
<p>
<P>
<H4>
3.0 FreeWRL Build and Installation
</H4>
<OL>

<LI>Grab the latest FreeWRL tar file, and untar it.
<P>
<LI>Verify that the <B>vrml.conf</B> 
file has good paths for the libraries and includes. 
<P>
I have included various configuration files to show examples of what
can be done. Of particular interest are <B>vrml.conf.rh7.2</B> and
<B>vrml.conf.localmesa</B>. You <B>will</B> wish to replace vrml.conf with one of these files.
<P>
If you are running on <B>Irix</B> copy vrml.conf.irix over vrml.conf, <B>and</B>
copy Plugin/netscape/Makefile.irix over Plugin/netscape/Makefile.
You should also verify that you are using GNU-Make; if not, you can get it from
the SGI freeware site mentioned above.
<P>
One additional  <B>Irix</B>  note: if your version of "make" is not gnumake, you
will need to install it, and use the following script to "make" freewrl. (this 
is on the bug list...)
<p>
$ for i in * ; do (cd $i && gmake) ; done
<P>$ gmake

<p>
FreeType version 2 has been in distributions for well over a year; FreeWRL now uses
it. Check that you have the library installed; the command "ldconfig -p | grep freetype"
will print the path, if it is installed. 
If you have an older distribution, you can get a new version of FreeType from
<A HREF="http://www.freetype.org">http://www.freetype.org</A>.
<P>
If you need them, the fonts that freewrl uses in a file called freewrl-fonts, available on
<A HREF="/en/html/FreeWRL/downloads/downloads">http://www.crc.ca/en/html/FreeWRL/downloads/downloads</A>.
Untar this file, and point the FREETYPE_FONT_PATH to this directory.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> some systems seem to have placed the FreeType include files properly, others have
the include files spread all over the place. for <B>RedHat 7.2</B>, make sure you
have a look at the FreeType section of vrml.conf.rh7.2.
<P>
<LI>Install Perl Modules; Irix will need all of these, Red Hat will
only need the ones indicated:<BR>    

<P>Digest-MD5-2.09
<BR>HTML-Parser-2.25        
<BR>MIME-Base64-2.11
<BR>URI-1.04
<BR>libnet-1.0607
<BR>libwww-perl-5.47
<BR>Image-Base-1.07	<B> Needed for RedHat 7.2</B>

</P>

<P>Installing these modules is a no-brainer; just untar     
each module as root, then go into the directory, and 
<BR>perl Makefile.PL
<BR>make
<BR>make install
</P>

Note that libwww-perl will most likely ask you if you want to reconfigure - I always just select the default.
<P>
<LI>ImageMagick is required for some conversions of graphics
files. The "convert" utility is used; this <B>should</B> now be
installed with any graphical Linux distribution. If you
can't find it, you can always download it from
<A HREF="http://www.imagemagick.org">http://www.imagemagick.org</A>
 or 
<A HREF="http://freeware.sgi.com">http://freeware.sgi.com/</A>

<P>
<LI>FreeWRL-0.33 (and possibly later?) does support MovieTexture nodes, video only. The tool
that is in use is one from the <A HREF="http://www.mpeg.org/MSSG/">MPEG Software Simulation Group</A>.
You will need the MPEG2 Video Codec installed (file mpeg2decode) and in your path when you make FreeWRL in order to have this work. Warning - the current method is very slow on startup.
We are working on a better method.
<P>
<LI>Make the Make file

<P>perl Makefile.PL</P>

<LI>Build/install FreeWRL
<P>make
<BR>make install (you have to be root of course)
</P>
<P>
<LI>Experimental SAI interface
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> You only need to do this if you wish to debug the SAI code.
<P> - mknod.javapipej p
<BR> - mknod.javapipep p</P>

<LI>Run the numbered tests.

<P>
There are quite a few tests in the "tests" directory.
<P>Run all of the numbered files (and any others that you want!) in the tests
directory. Note that some use javascript, so you will be testing javascript, too.</P>


</OL>
<h4>
4.0 Installing Java support
</H4>

<P><B>4.1)</B> Javascript:</P>
<P>
In the basic install, you should have installed the java support to allow some of the
test programs in the tests directory to work. (eg, 7.wrl, 8.wrl, and 10.wrl)
<P>
If these programs don't run, then go back and make FreeWRL it so that it does work.
<P><B>4.2)</B> EAIcode:</P>
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> This is in active development, so may not work. 
<P>
The EAI classes have been gathered into the Java archive vrml.jar. A java.policy
file is used to handle EAI code access to the local filesystem and sockets.
<P>
<LIST>
<LI>cd into the tests/AddRemove directory in the build tree.
<LI>Read the README file in there to see what the latest commands are
<LI>Send a case of beer to the developers, for their outstanding work.
</LIST>

<P><B>4.2)</B> SAIcode:</P>
<p>
<B>NOTE:</B> This is in active development, so may not work. 
<P>
<LIST>
<LI>cd into the tests/SAIClick directory in the build tree.
<LI>Read the README file in there to see what the latest commands are
</LIST>


<P><B>5.0 Getting it all to work with Netscape.</B></P>

<P><B>5.1)</B> Follow the
<A HREF="Plugin/readme.html">instructions</A> in the Plugin readme file.</P>
<P>
If FreeWRL was built correctly, then the Netscape Plugin was
installed in Netscape's system plugins directory.</P>
<P>
<P><B>6.0 X3D compatibility.</B></P>

<P><B>6.1)</B> Go to the x3d directory, and follow the

<A HREF="x3d/readme.html">instructions</A>.</P>
<P>
<P><B>7.0 Getting it to work with external sensors.</B></P>
<P>
<B>7.1)</B> CRC's "Flying Chair".
<P>
This chair can be seen in the "links" section. The code to 
run this chair is freely available, at:
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mvip/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mvip/</A>
<P>

<B>7.2)</B> Thrustmaster style Joystick 
<P>
The 2-D joystick interface is available at: 
<A HREF="/html/FreeWRL/downloads/joystick/Joystick-1.0.tar.gz">http://www.crc.ca/FreeWRL/download/joystick/Joystick-1.0.tar.gz</A>, and the 3D joystick
interface is available as part of the chair code, as outlined above.

<P><B>7.3)</B> Data Glove.</P>
<P>
This interface is being actively worked on.
<P>
<P><B>6.4)</B> Spaceball 3D positioning mouse.</P>
<P>
This interface is being actively worked on.
<P>
<P><B>7.4)</B> Touchscreens.</P>
<P>
One of our FreeWRL users has made a very interesting touchscreen
interface to FreeWRL. This code will be incorporated into FreeWRL
when it is complete.
<P>
<P><B>7.5)</B> Polhemus/Virtual Research goggles with position sensor.</P>
This works very well with the "Flying Chair" mentioned above, but if you 
wish to run this alone, without joystick (and chair!), here are the
directions:
<P><B>7.5.1)</B> Polhemus Position Sensor.</P>  

<P> - Untar and compile the code in the Polhemus 1.0. tarfile. 
<BR>- run minicom (with modem in it strings set to null) and see if you can get any input.  
<BR> - align the Fastrak. I use the A0 command, as found in      the manual, to do the allignment. (&quot;Enhanced Allignment Procedure, pg 48a of my manual-Sept 1998)</P>        

<P>eg:
<BR>(in minicom)
<BR>A0
<BR>P
<BR>(now, move the sensor 24&quot; in positive X axis)
<BR>P
<BR>(now, move the sensor 24&quot; in positive Y axis)
<BR>P
<BR>Exit minicom</P>


<P> - run the program Polhemus/termite to get the polhemus interface   code working. Note - headset should be pointed at where you want &quot;front&quot; to be.</P>


<P><B>7.5.2)</B> Virtual Research goggles
<P> An option has been added to FreeWRL to run in full screen mode just for these goggles. Start FreeWRL with the "-fullscreen" option; eg:
<P>
freewrl tests/1.wrl -best -fullscreen -geometry 640x480
