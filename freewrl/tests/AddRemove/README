The EAI classes are a "work in progress"; and are just getting
rebuilt.

Things to watch out for:

1) sometimes the appletviewer does not shutdown correctly.

ps -aux | grep jdk 

to find out if one is running, and
kill "pid" (the number of the process) to stop it.

2) the appletviewer now ignores the CLASSPATH. Sheesh. Right
now, the vrml/* classes are within the current working directory;
even symbolic links don't work.

So, copy all files (and directories) from the 
<freewrl builddir>/java/classes/* to here.

eg, in this directory, type:

	cp -r ../../java/classes/* .


You should then have a "vrml" directory here, and then the
standalone script should work.

3) verify all paths in the script "standalone", to run it with
the appletviewer. It assumes that both freewrl and the appletviewer
are installed and in your path.
