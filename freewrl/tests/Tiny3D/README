As of 0.27, Tiny3D now works. 

BUT -- the appletviewer no longer uses CLASSPATH (!!!) so please
copy over these files to the ../../java directory, and run from
there. 

eg, in this directory, type:

	cp -r ../../java/classes/* .

This will put the EAI classes local to the Tiny3D program, and
the appletviewer will be happy.

Anybody want to investigate a workaround? IF not, check back
here later...

John.
