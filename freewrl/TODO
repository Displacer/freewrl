TODO wishlist for 0.28 release.

STARTED: Fran Taylor sent in some great tips for getting FreeWRL to work 
	better with Netscape. Implement and document these.

DONE:	EAI CreateTest working (needs replaceworld EAI call)

DONE:	DEF and USE's for textures.

DONE:	Rectangular pictures are not mapped correctly.

DONE:	Extrusion endCaps are facing the wrong way! (begincaps are ok)

Does render_polyrep'd nodes use display/texture lists?

DONE:	do_textures smooths textures, but make it NOT smooth pixeltextures. (need another
parameter) - see t4*wrl in luigi's home directory

DONE???: Try GL_CULLing backgrounds and basic shapes. (COSMO on the SGI does this)
this should double rendering speed for them.

Extrusion Textures not working reliably.

IndexedFaceSets are not using all points correctly. (check out the lightning bolt
example) (Kiwano.wrl, and ast.wrl)

DEF and USE in createVrmlFromString examples (eg, Etiennes perl tests)

More SAI work.
	- automatic creation of pipes.

H-ANIM working.
	- Nancy "works", but:	
		1) run mode, arms flail around.
		2) face is not good. (IFS problem, again)
		3) buttons don't float properly. (rotation problem,
		   as in the robotic finger test???)
		4) what happened to the "stand" button?



GeoVRML working.
