- Make FreeWRL into a perl module, and a couple of RPMs. 

- textures on complex objects.

- rotation of finger in tests/22.wrl

- Implement Sound Nodes.

- Pointsets are not visible when hw accel; verify OpenGL calls.

- Full Conformance.


EAI "funnies":


- There are some browser calls that exist in FreeWRL that
  I have not created the EAI code for...
  Need to go through the EAI spec and fill in missing
  classes/methods.

- package up the eai code in a .zip package, and find out where to
  put it in Netscape's CLASSPATH for Netscape work.

- Netscape gives applet security probs when trying to open up
  the EAI socket connection when running the applet off of a 
  remote machine.

Stuff to do, easy ones first, more intricate ones later.

- OrientationInterpolator problems when one of the axes goes
  from 1 to -1.

- Billboard: 0 0 0 is not correct, or is it ??

- comment set_bind

- smooth normals

- normalPerVertex code

- normals as arguments

- smoother truetype: actually do bezier points..

- proper reaction to sensor disabling while active

- text justification 

- proper VisibilitySensor

- BBox optimizations

- Comment more

- elevationgrid triangulation: choose diagonal nicer.

- correct primitive texturing coordinates

- make Text generate polyrep instead of just rendering - then we can
  do button click / collision detection.

- key remapping.

- Transparency
- transparency (sourcebook ch10 fig10

- Anchor: make it do something..

- lights properly

- viewpoints with jump false

- SphereSensor: virtual sphere stays, may not move with coordinate
  motions -- ????? What does it mean e.g. when the user moves?

- as_string: ensure DEF/USE ordering correct-- how?

- JavaScript: rest of support. 
  Remember to do node.thing.thang correctly in the same way as 
  the parameters of the node itself -- but have to notice the events
  immediately. Hmmm...

- Collision, ground following, gravity (JAS - Collision node children
  works as of a.0.20)

- fix bindable nodes' loading so that the correct nodes get bound..
  nodes inside protos don't currently count.

- separate RFields into eventIns, eventOuts and fields

- multithreading: load & execute?

- SOFTREFS!!!
