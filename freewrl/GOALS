Goals of the VRML::Browser, in order of importance

	- EAI integration for shared virtual worlds (john.stewart@crc.ca)
	- absolute compliance to VRML97 spec. If extensions appear, a 
	  "anal-retentive" mode will be provided which recognizes just
	  VRML97
	- easy portability for many platforms
	- lightweight - include as few big libraries, as little code
 	  as possible. 
	- coded in short form - use code generation if repetitive
  	  tasks occur.
	- comprehensive support of different scripting languages, file 
	  types and interfaces
	- free software, with GNU copyleft.
	- do hard things first so that they won't be extremely difficult
	  and kludgy later on
	- extensibility 
	- good performance
	- authoring
