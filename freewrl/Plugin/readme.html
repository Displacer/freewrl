<H1>What does the Plugin do?</H1>
<P>
It handles the following:
<OL>
<LI>Integration with Mozilla, including all of the quit and destroy functionality.
<LI>URL Retrieval via Mozilla - this gives us caching and proxy access.
<LI>Java EAI integration.
</OL>

<H2>Building and using the FreeWRL Plugin</H2>

<OL>
<LI> Compile and install FreeWRL
<LI> Exit all running  Browser windows on your box
</OL>
<H3>Testing the software:</H3>
<OL>
	<LI> Startup Mozilla. (Other browsers - check your documentation)
<LI> In the "Locations" window, type "about:plugins". You will see what plugins
are installed; you should see the FreeWRL plugin listed.
<LI> Open a VRML file; eg, get the file over http or open the "tests/1.wrl" file,
by following the "File -> Open Page -> Choose" dialogue.
</OL>

<H3>If the VRML file is not rendered, make sure that the plugin has been
associated with the correct mime type and file suffix.</H3>
The FreeWRL plugin is associated with "x-world/x-vrml" and file suffix "wrl".
It appears that the file suffix does not always get associated with the
Plugin, so only the text of the VRML file will appear.
<BR>
The following steps should fix this problem:
<OL>
<LI> Follow the "Edit -> Preferences... -> Navigator -> Applications" dialog.
<LI> Reselect the "FreeWRL VRML Browser" associated with the Plug In combo
box in the "Handled By" section.
<LI> This action should fill in the Description and Suffixes fields.
</OL>

<H3>Further Notes:</H3>
<OL>
<LI> EAI now works with Netscape (verifying for working with Mozilla, etc).
The EAI tests contain unsigned jar files that
contain the applet classes.  The EAI archive vrml.jar is also unsigned.
If you want to try these tests, you will have to deal with the Netscape Java Security
dialog.
<LI> The Makefile.PL file now looks in /usr/X11R6/include and /usr/X11/include for header
files; if this gives you problems, or if there are more directories that should be
looked in for your Operating System, please email us.
</OL>
<I>The FreeWRL Plugin uses a template by Netscape, and some window rehosting code from XSwallow.
