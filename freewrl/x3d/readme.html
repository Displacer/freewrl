<H1>What is X3D compatibility, and what is X3D?</H1>
<P>
X3D is the follow on for VRML, and is being defined by the 
 <A HREF="http://www.web3d.org">Web3D Consortium</A>.
<P>
Don Brutzman of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, created 
a template that allows an XML tool to translate X3D to VRML. We use this template
to do our conversions.
<P>
<H2>Building and using X3D Compatibility.</H2>

<H3>Making the software: </H3>
<P>
X3D Compatibility is built in. However, it does need the following:
<OL>
<LI> Saxon, from 
 <A HREF="http://saxon.sourceforge.net">Saxon home</A>. All we need from this
package is the Java .jar file, "saxon.jar".
<LI> Edit the "vrml.conf" file, and verify the path to this jar file.
</OL>

<H3>Installing the software:</H3>

<OL>
<LI> Compile and install FreeWRL
</OL>
<H3>Testing the software:</H3>
<OL>
<li> run any of the numbered .xml tests in the "tests" directory.
</OL>
	
<H3>Further Notes:</H3>
<OL>
<LI>The translation process needs ".dtd" files, as referenced in the .xml files. 
The first reference is for a web reference; the second is a reference to the 
local file system.
<P>
If, like me, you have an http proxy in place, the local file will be referenced.
You will have to ensure that the path in these files is correct by either:
<UL>
<LI>editing the path in the .xml files
<LI>putting in symbolic links so that the files can be found in this directory.
(they are included here)
</UL>
<P>
An example of the type of error you are likely to see is: 
<P>
"java.io.FileNotFoundException: /www.web3D.org/TaskGroups/x3d/translation/x3d-compact.dtd"
<P>
One (not totally satisfactory) solution is to go as root:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>cd /
<LI>ln -s . C:
<LI>ln -s . www.web3D.org
<LI>ln -s . TaskGroups
<LI>ln -s . x3d
<LI>ln -s /usr/local/src/FreeWRL-whatever-it-is/x3d translation
</UL>
</OL>
