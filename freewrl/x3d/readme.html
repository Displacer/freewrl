<H1>What is X3D compatibility, and what is X3D?</H1>
<P>
X3D is the follow on for VRML, and is being defined by the
 <A HREF="http://www.web3d.org">Web3D Consortium</A>.
<P>
Don Brutzman of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, created
a template that allows an XML tool to translate X3D to VRML. We use this template
to do our conversions.
<P>
FreeWRL now uses the utility xsltproc to convert from x3d to vrml; this utility should
be found on all linux distributions. Future parsing without conversion is planned.
